# IBM Challenge - Chatbot | FIAP - 2020

I developed a chatbot for the challenge cited, in this case, was to do something that said the benefits of technology in the pandemic. I did a chatbot to help a hypothetical language school. However, without integration with the database, it was generic and could be used by more schools, or even institutions in other areas that needed registration.

I will leave json in the repository and the link to test the chatbot, if you want.
